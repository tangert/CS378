# Tyler Angert CS378 HW3: k-means clustering

## Introduction

This project implements k-means clustering algorithm in pure Python.

## Running the program

On a computer with python installed: 

run `python kmeans.py INPUT_DATA_SET K_VALUE OUTPUT_FILE`
ex: `python kmeans.py "iris.data.txt" 3 "iris-results"`

## Notes

The program doesn't read from ".data" or other non-traditionally extended files so just make sure that the extension is ".txt".
